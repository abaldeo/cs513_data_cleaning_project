# CS 513: Theory and Practice of Data Cleaning - Final Project 
The goal of the group project is to conduct an end-to-end data cleaning project, using the various 
tools and techniques that we have covered throughout the course. In addition to the main tools 
that we used in class (i.e., RegEx, OpenRefine, Datalog, SQL, and Python), you are welcome to 
use other tools. For example, you may want to use any of the research protot ypes mentioned 
(e.g., YesWorkflow or the OpenRefine companion tools such as or2yw), or commercial tools (e.g., 
Trifacta Wrangler, Tableau, etc.) In your report you will then document how you used them.
Project  Phases.        The project is organized into t wo phases,  each with its own set of deliverables. 
See  Coursera  for  the  timeline  and  details.
